## Introduction

TBD

## Problem statement

TBD

## Common use-case in its brief

1. [**Use case 1:**](./src/Usecase1/ReadMe.md) Date time conversion between different timezones

    We might bump into a situation where we need to convert time from one time zone to another timezone.

2. [**Use case 2:**](./src/Usecase2/ReadMe.md) Date conversion between different formats

    There are several formats of representing time which could vary according to user preferences.

3. [**Use case 3:**](./src/Usecase3/ReadMe.md) Date time calculations to get the difference in time; with/without timezone

    We might come across a situation where we need to find differences between the time which might be stored in different formats and could include or exclude timezones.

4. [**Use case 4:**](./src/Usecase4/ReadMe.md) Storing time-related data in the database and backend data consumption

    We might encounter a situation where the front end needs to send date-time data to the backend and handle operations accordingly.

5. [**Use case 5:**](./src/Usecase5/ReadMe.md) Displaying date time data based on local

    There might be situations when we need to store time in UTC and display it based on the userâ€™s location.

6. [**Use case 6:**](./src/Usecase6/ReadMe.md) Handling date time in different rendering paradigms

    Situations when stored time is consumed on the front end using different rendering paradigms and creating issues due to changes in date-time value.

7. [**Use case 7:**](./src/Usecase7/ReadMe.md) Handling recurring dates and events

    Situations where we need to keep track of recurring events at different timezone.
